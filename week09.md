## Reflection

The purpose of this paper was to identify opportunities to
support nutrition security and equality among low
socioeconomic situations.

To achieve this, the researchers conducted interviews and
home visits of lower to middle income households in Indiana.

They investigated how technology played a role in how the
participants approached nutrition and how they selected their
meals.

They also grouped shopping behaviours into different 
archetypes, including "inventory shoppers," "menu planners,"
and "adaptive shoppers."

In each of these archetypes they investigated the role of
different factors, such as affordable and healthy food
access, understanding food labeling, and nutrition education.

Based on these archetypes, they recommend different design
implications of how technology may be of use.

- implement resource management strategies,
such as lists or some kind of scheduling.

- implement strategies to leverage deals, suchas aiding in identifying lower-priced items or appropriate
substitutions in line with a person's budget.

- implement a running list as a planning device between shopping
trips.

They also reviewed nutrition literature to reveal three
categories of contextual and behavioural factors that had a 
greater contribution to food security and dietary quality: food 
procurement and preparation behaviours; parental, adolescent,
and child behaviours; and psychosocial factors.

They also identify four categories of behaviors to work around
barriers to food security: institutional, social network,
food provisioning, and food consumption.

They categorize logistical barriers to grocery shopping based
on a person's ability to overcome these barriers as shown below.

<br />
<br />
during their interviews, they investigated the interviewee's
approach to procuring food, and investigate how technology has
an impact on this process as can be seen in the figure below

<br />
<br />
They found that technology made the greatest difference in
food consumption, followed by food provisioning, with
participants using social media and search engines and YouTube 
for information on food and diet, but technology did not have
much of an impact in connecting people to social networks
or supporting institutional strategies.
