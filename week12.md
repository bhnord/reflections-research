## Reflection

This paper was about giving context to visualizations, to make sure that user understanding is achieved, as well as maintaining
transparency about the data source.

They specifically explore the effect of metadata as context to disclose data source or as instructions for decoding the visualizations.

They pursued two experiments to determine metadata's effect.

The first experiment was on which types of visualizations, and which goals of the visualizations were most affected by
which types of metadata.

Participants were given a visualization, and then asked which kind of metadata would be most helpful in reaching a certain goal
with a multiple choice styled response.

At the end of the first experiment, the results showed that their participants were most interested in metadata related to the
visualization's encoding for goals related to understanding, as well as metadata about the source of the data, for trustworthiness.

Piggybacking on this first experiment, they took these same two types of metadata, and ran another experiment on how these types of
metadata held impact.

The second experiment explored how different kinds of metadata impacted "transparency, trustworthiness and persuasiveness,
information relevance, and understanding."

Participants saw two pairs of visualization, for each pair, one had metadata, and one did not.

They were then asked to answer two open-ended questions based on the visualizations, and rate the visualizations on scales
related to transparency and relevance.

At the end of their experiments for experiment two, they participants suggested that visualizations that included
metadata was viewed as more thorough than visualizations without metadata, but the comprehensibility of these visualizations
stayed mostly the same.

They also discovered that the metadata had some impact on which information from the visualization participants recalled as
important or interesting.
